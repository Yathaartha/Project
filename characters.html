    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Saber
        </h2>
        <p> Servants placed within this class are agile and powerful melee warriors armed with swords. It is commonly assumed to be the best class overall, with high ratings in all categories. It also possesses the Riding Skill like the Rider class.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Lancer
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are very agile and skilled with long-range melee weapons, such as spears, lances, etc.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Archer
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are usually proficient with projectiles and can survive longer without a Master nearby, thanks to their special ability Independent Action; the strongest Archers can be difficult to control at times, in fact, due to their near-total independence from their "Masters".</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Assassin
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are proficient in assassination. Within certain wars, only Hassan-i-Sabbah can be summoned due to the etymology of the word "Assassin" acting as a catalyst. The Assassins' special ability is Presence Concealment, which allows them to remain undetected. Offset by their stealth is their moderate combat skills. Due to this, Assassins often target Masters instead of Servants.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Caster
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are adept in magecraft and have a special ability akin to a Reality Marble, called Territory Creation, which alters or creates space around them to enhance their sorcery.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Rider
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class place emphasis upon speed and powerful Noble Phantasms, which often include their mounts. Their special Skill is Riding, which allows them to fully utilize abilities of their mounts (which can range from simple horses to mechanical vehicles to divine or supernatural creatures).</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Berserker
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are always heroes who have gone berserk in their lifetime. This trait allows them to use the special ability Mad Enhancement, which trades their consciousness (i.e. sanity) for a large power boost. Most Masters are incapable of controlling their Servant once Mad Enhancement has been activated, which eventually results in their death.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Ruler
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class govern the Holy Grail Wars, granted rights of an administrator and Command Spells. While typically saints are summoned into it while managing wars related to the Holy Grail, others can be summoned into the class if they are impartial.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <h2>
            Faker
        </h2>
        <p>Servants placed within this class are represented by fakes, summoning counterfeits and body doubles.</p><br>
    </div>
